      <h2>About This Site</h2>
      <p>
        As of the most recent update to this description, this is a website to play with web development tools,
        and to keep track of all my good qualities and attributes (theres just so many). If I acheive global domination,
        I'll say it all started right here. I wouldn't actually say that because it would be a lie, my plans go back to the third grade.
        The memory of loosing my lunchbox on a half day still motivates me more than those youtube videos of some guy yelling platitudes
        over energetic music, and I still keep extra snacks on my person just in case.
